# Openness

The project will be released under a **proper MIT open source license** when/if the Danish Public Library Sector decides, that they want to use the app, and pays for the development cost. Until then it is only released as Creative Commons BY-NC-ND, and copyrighted by solsort.com ApS. The cost calculated from actual number hours used on the project, plus expenses such as: transport to meetings with stakeholders, buying of graphics assets for the projects, etc. Contributors should keep track of how many hours we use on the project. 

The development happens in full openness on the project github repository, and release status, features etc. can be seen/discussed here.
