#leiningen

Installing leiningen is pretty basic. Simply download the lein file from the internet and make it available on your PATH

See the instructions on http://leiningen.org/ 

After making "lein" available on your PATH you can run:

lein figwheel

now the project should be available from http://localhost:3449  and should be updated everytime you alter a file.
